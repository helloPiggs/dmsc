## Squirrel Eat Squirrel

This squirrel game meets all of the basic requirements, as well as other advanced things such as eating sounds, perlin noise, flowers, a feature where "enemy squirrels bounce off of trees/rocks/etc. when they are small, and the player moves around the trees/rocks also when they are small, a feature that adds acorns which restore 1 health point when the player eats them, and a big robot that has health, and kills the player and the "enemy squirrels". The most difficult part of this was trying to balance the game so that it would be fun to play. This seems like it'd be an easy thing to do, but it's actually harder than I originally thought it would be.

When making this game, me and my group went through a few phases before reaching the final product. Early on there was no robot, no acorns, and no avoid mechanic. These were things that were added as we continued to work. The robot was added to introduce a more challenging aspect to the game. Before the robot, the game was a bit too dull. The acorns were added to make the game last longer. Sometimes the player would die too quickly to progress to a larger size, so having the acorns to heal helped that. The avoid mechanic was added to make the game a bit more realistic. Without it, the squirrels would run all over the trees.

One challenge we faced was that when the enemy squirrels got too big, they wouldn't be able to pass the trees and they would get stuck. We fixed this by making it so that when the squirrels got to a certain size, they no longer avoid the trees. This not only prevented them from getting stuck, but it also makes more sense, because if there was a huge squirrel larger than trees, it would be able to walk around freely over the trees without having to turn around.

Another challenge we faced was that initially, all of the larger enemy squirrels would eat the smaller ones before the player could get a chance, thus getting way bigger than the player could possibly be very quickly. We fixed this by tweaking the rate at which both the player and enemy squirrels increase in size when eating smaller squirrels, and also by adjusting the size of new squirrels when they spawn.

The terrain is generated in a very simple way. There is a forest class and a flower class. The forest class displays rocks and trees (chosen randomly), and the flower class displays flowers and bushes (also chosen randomly). These two are pretty much the same as they are both displayed at random positions on the screen. The only difference is that the squirrels avoid the objects in the forest class but not the flower objects.

The robot works by moving around the screen similar to the enemy squirrels. The differences between the robot and the enemy squirrels are that the robot has health (the enemy squirrels die in one hit), and the robot kills the player in one shot regardless of health. Just like the enemy squirrels, the robot can be killed either by the player or by the enemy squirrels, if it is smaller (than the player or enemy squirrel).
