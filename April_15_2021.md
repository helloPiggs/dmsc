## Squirrel Eat Squirrel

This squirrel game meets all of the basic requirements, as well as other advanced things such as eating sounds, perlin noise, flowers, a feature where "enemy squirrels bounce off of trees/rocks/etc. when they are small, a feature that adds acorns which restore 1 health point when the player eats them, and a big robot that has health, and kills the player and the "enemy squirrels". The most difficult part of this was trying to balance the game so that it would be fun to play. This seems like it'd be an easy thing to do, but it's actually harder than I originally thought it would be.
