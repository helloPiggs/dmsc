Today I worked on making drawings in LOGO. I made the letter “R”, and attempted to draw an elephant. I did not succeed, but it was fun nonetheless. I liked using LOGO because it adds an unique way of making art that isn't found when using a pencil and paper, or modern art programs like photoshop, ms paint, etc. The next time I use LOGO, I’d like to experiment more with the different parts of the code (i.e. random elements or the pen down). Maybe I can make a better elephant that way.

## Situationism:
Situationism is “the theory that human behavior is determined by surrounding circumstances rather than by personal qualities” according to the Oxford dictionary. Situationism was studied in the Stanford prison experiment, where the people in the experiment were tested to see whether or not they’d be corrupted by the power of being a prison guard (surrounding circumstances), to act differently than they normally would (personal qualities).

Situationism can show the complexity of what computing is capable of, because it suggests that humans behave like a computer algorithm would, and if that’s the case, then it would maybe be possible to replicate the human mind and behavior with code.

According to Tech Based Teaching on medium.com, algorithmic thinking is “the use of algorithms, or step-by-step sets of instructions, to complete a task.”

Computational thinking can be applied to non-computational environments in the same way we did the algorithmic walk: by writing an algorithm, and behaving according to its command.

It would probably be possible to write a software to slow down, focus, and enhance life outside of productivity, etc., but to do so effectively, I’d imagine that it would need to be a deep, layered, complex algorithm, otherwise it would eventually become just as restricting as any other obligation we face in our daily lives.


## Language for algorithmic walk:

F= keep forward
A= turn around
R= turn right
L= turn left

?= generate random # from 1-4 (1=F, 2=A, 3=R, 4=L)

#WUNAT= this is the unit of measurement (Walk Until Next Available Turn). The “#” will be replaced with a number, and represents how far you will walk. For example, if it says 3WUNAT, then you will walk past 2 possible turns, and turn on the third available turn. 

START= start walk

END= finish walk

In the case of F, A, R, L, and ?, if the programmed/generated direction is impossible (i.e. left turn is programmed, when only a right turn is available) keep forward until the programmed turn becomes available. If forward is unavailable, then turn around, and keep forward until the programmed turn is available. If the programmed turn doesn’t come available even after turning around, accept defeat, and return home.
