Today I worked on making drawings in LOGO. I made the letter “R”, and attempted to draw an elephant. I did not succeed, but it was fun nonetheless. I liked using LOGO because it adds an unique way of making art that isn't found when using a pencil and paper, or modern art programs like photoshop, ms paint, etc. The next time I use LOGO, I’d like to experiment more with the different parts of the code (i.e. random elements or the pen down). Maybe I can make a better elephant that way.
