## Theoretical Tool

If I were to imagine my own tool to create things with, I would create an art software that is controlled with a controller with various buttons, switchs, dials, analog sticks, etc. rather than a mouse and keyboard or a drawing pad like you'd typically use with photoshop, ms paint, and other popular programs. I would want the software to have different ways of making art than those other popular programs as well beacuse it's on a computer and doesn't need to use the same paintbrush/bezier pen/etc. like others do. Ideally it would also be customizable and open source so anyone else who wanted to use it and adjust it like others do. The software would by called Everyone's Art Software because it's an art software made by everyone and for everyone. The limit that may exist is the necessity for a special controller. To work around that, you'd need to program your own way to control it with a mouse and keyboard, or some other controller.

## NoPaint

I believe that anyone who uses No Paint is both the artist, as well as the collaborator. Because of how specific many of the "events" are in the software, I'd say that the art made using No Paint is a sort of collaboration between the user, and the person who programmed it. Randomness plays a pretty heavy role in No Paint, moreso than in other art softwares like Photoshop for example, where users have complete control over pretty much any minute detail. By adding in randomness, the artist is forced to give up some level of control, and that can lead to some feeling restricted, but for others it may fuel their creativity.
