## Livecoding with TidalCycles/MiniTidal

Using TidalCycles/MiniTidal to make livecoded music is a fun and strange experience. As someone who loves listening to music, but has never made any music myself, I can say I had a fun time. Using code to make music is weird because it's not something I've ever thought about, and admittedly I had pretty much no idea what my code was gonna sound like until I pressed play. Maybe that's something that comes with time and experience. Regradless it's cool to play around and experiment with different sounds. My partner for the assignment is someone who knew a little more about the language than what we learned in the class, and showed me a coupkle of things like the pan which lets you choose the direction of the audio (as in which side of the headphones/speakers), as well as how to use vowels, which I'm not entirely sure what they do, but I like the way the vowels sound. I think they change the sounds in the code (e.g. arpy:1) to sound like robotic vowels, but that's probably an oversimplification.

When we did this in class, I had no Idea which sounds came from what I wrote, and which sounds were made by others. This time, with only one other person, I had an easier time understanding what I was doing vs what they were doing. I think this made me feel more comfortable experimenting with the code.

density 4 $ chop 4 $ slow 2 $ s "bd*2 sd hh*2 sd" #up "-20" # pan "1"
