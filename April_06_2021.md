Using hydra to create visuals was an interesting and confusing experience. At first I had a hard time understanding what each number was responsible for, so when I changed the numbers, the resulting image was mostly unintentional. After a while though I got the hang of things a bit. The first example above was the first one I made when I didn't understand what I was doing, and the second one was one that I made when I had a moderate understanding of what I was doing. That being said, I would still say that even though I was confused at first, the language is pretty inyuitive as it doesn't take long to start getting used to it, and I can imagine that even someone without any prior coding experience can start working with hydra and understand how to use it relatively quickly. As of right now, I prefer p5.js over hydra for creating images, as I'm much more used to programming in p5, however I imagine that hydra allows for a lot more complex visuals with substantially less lines of code than p5, which would probably make hydra preferable for making visuals once I'm more comfortable with the language.
