### Concept

For my final project, I created a procedurally generated town. In this town, there are houses and people. You can walk around outside, and walk into your neighbor’s houses. You can also talk to your neighbors. You’re neighbors’ appearances, houses, names, and speech are procedurally generated.


### Challenges

One of the biggest challenges I faced in making this project was allowing for each house to have its own size, color, position, collisions, roof, etc. I kept on running into issues until I eventually managed to get it done (albeit in an inefficient and convoluted manner).
Another challenge I faced was trying to figure out how to make sure the neighbor characters didn’t spawn on top of each other, a house, or the player. I eventually solved this by only displaying them when they were not on top of a house/player/etc, but this created another issue. They would flash all around the screen until they finally figured out a position that was allowed. I fixed this by making a loading screen.

### Approach

My approach in making this project was to take things one step at a time. The first thing I programmed was a [very simple map](https://editor.p5js.org/rrenaldo2/sketches/WkElsGbmH). From there, I built upon my code to add proper visuals, neighbors with collisions that worked similar to the houses I had already started on, house interiors, speech, etc. Along the way, I would make sure every new thing I added functioned properly before adding anything else. This helped me make sure my code was never completely broken.
